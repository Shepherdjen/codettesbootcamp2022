# Business model canvas
## 3.1 What is a business model canvas?
A business model canvas(a one sheet business plan) is a visual representation of a business model, highlighting all key strategic factors. So a business model canvas basically gives you an overview of the company's workings, customers, revenue streams etc.
Business model canvases are most used by start-ups but it is also used to document existing companyâ€™s. 
Alexander Oswalder was the first person to propose the use of a business model canvas. 
Before making a business model canvas you have to have a business plan (Plan for successful operation of a business or startup that identifies Sources of Revenue and Target Customer Base combined with details of Financing), only then can you start making a canvas.
## 3.2 the building blocks
When making a Business model canvas you have 9 essential building blocks.
Those building blocks are :
Key partners: who will be your key partner/suppliers? Which key resources do they provide?
Key activities :what are the key processes and task we need to create our value proposition?
Key resources: what key resources do our key activities require?
Value proposition: Which of our customers problems are we helping to solve?Value proposition look like?
Customer relationships:what type of relationship do you want with customers?Which fits best with each segments?
Channels:To which channels do each of our segments want to be reached?Which ones are most cost efficient?
Customer segments :For whom are we creating value?Who are the most important customers.?
cost structure: I mean and elements of operational expense? (Floating variable cost,inventory ,WIP and capital assets).
Revenue streams: From which channels and segments? how much does each contribute to overall revenue?

## 3.3 Why use BMC?
A few resons to use a BMC are because it describe your business in page, it si costumer focused,its easy to present, Easy to benchmark peers/competitors etc.
## 3.4 my BMC
Before making my Bmc i had to research about my product, what is needed to make it , the development process, what kind of value it will bring to customers' lives and how I will finance building the product.

# 3D Printing
## 7.1 What is 3d printing?
3D printing is the act of adding layers and layers of filament (thermoplastic feedstock for fused deposition modeling 3D printers) to create a solid object using a 3d printer. 3D printing is an additive process because you are adding layers to create an object. 
## 7.2 type of filament?
Filament is the thermoplastic feedstock for deposition modeling 3d printers. There are many different types of filament but in the lab i will be working with the PLA (polylactic acid filament ) and the ABS( acrylonitrile butadiene styrene filament).
![image14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109770876/182914823-e14a635a-bddb-4b92-8f57-5a7b281bfcd3.png)

Although both filaments are thermoplastic, The PLA is organic , stronger and stiffer than the ABS but the PLA has a big disadvantage because it does not have very good heat resistant properties because of this PLA is more of a hobbyist material. ABS on the other hand is weaker and less rigid than than the PLA  but it's also tougher and lighter than the PLA. That is why ABS is the preferred filament when making prototypes.
## 7.3 printers
There are two printers in the lab, the anycubic 4 max pro and the anycubic predator(deltabot).
The anycubic 4 max pro has an enclosed printing space with a large build volume to enhance printing quality. It is also out of box and there is no need to assemble. It is also safe for children because it has an optional auto power off feature. There is also a sensor that turns off the machine when it runs out of filament.

The anycubic predator is a bit more for advanced 3d printing. It uses delta bot ( 3 robotic hands attached to the printhead to deposit material. This is the printer that I will be using in this bootcamp.

## 7.4 printing software Cura 5.0.0.
For the boot camp i will be using Cura 5.0.0. I prefer to use this version because 1. It is the latest version and 2. Its is easier to use because of it has different profiles with preset parameters( this was not available in the older versions.)
I downloaded Cura from this link :https://www.windowsinside.com/software/ultimaker-cura/download this version can be used on a laptop with 32 bit and 64 bit.

## 7.5 Basic PLA parameters
There are some basic parameters you should/ pay attention to when 3D printing. What you need to pay attention to is the : Quality, speed and temperature, filament, fill , support and machine.
Quality: there are 3 important things to pay attention to by quality. The layer height(the height that each printed layer will have), shell thickness(the thickens of the other shell of what you are printing) and enable retraction(retraction has to be enabled or else the filament will leak when the nozzle is moving from point a to point b)
Speed and temperature: the3 important things to pay attention here to are the: print speed mm/%(the speed at which the machine prints),printing temp(the temp at which the filament will become liquid), bed temperature( the bed that will be used to print also need to be hot(so the temp of the plate)).
Filament: here there are two things to pay attention too. 1. The diameter: this depends completely on the size of the filament you are using and nozzle size for example the PLA filament is 1.75 mm. So for the the diameter i will put 1.75 mm. 2.  The second thing to pay attention too is the flow:
Fill : Here you need to pay attention 1. the bottom/ top thickness: this like the shell thickness 2.full density:  this is to determine how solid you want your object to be. The higher the density the more solid your object will be .
Also the higher the density the longer it will take to print.
Support: here you pay attention to support type: this has to be enabled so your 3D print will be supported or else it will collapse. Platform adh type: this is so the machine print a parameter around your 3D before it start on your design so the filament can start running.
Machine: pay attention to the nozzle size.

## 7.6 Setting up Cura and Using it.
After installing Cura I needed to set it up so I could use it. This was easy because as stated in 7.4 This version of cura already has a lot of presets.
First thing you need to do after installing cura is adding a printer. This is done by going to settings, the add printer ,then add a non network printer and then selecting the printer you will be using. I am using anycubic predator so i had to scroll down to anycubic and selected anycubic predator.

settings:

Printer:

Press on add a non-networked printer:

Select printer you will be using:
![image13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109770876/182916009-df26687c-bd58-44e1-8f91-2869e2734ba7.png)


### 7.6.1 checking printers
After adding a printer you can go back to check and see if its has been added by going back to setting and hovering over  printer. The printer that you have added should show up there.
For example:
![image3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109770876/182916452-9b30a0e8-675b-4603-8432-449f0f6e6f7a.png)

Since i only have anycubic added for now that is the only one that has shown up, but if you have more printers added they will show up.
### 7.6.2 deleting printers
Now if you have a printer added but want to remove it. That is very simple to do.
Simply go back to setting then printers and select manage printers. In manage printer select the printer you want to delete and then click on the right options list and press remove.

![image4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109770876/182916638-4c183a6e-7d32-41c5-8415-ec626e26af58.png)

![image5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109770876/182916761-05153a7b-0175-46bb-a5ad-9e0eef10f04f.png)





### 7.6.3 checking the dimensions
After selecting the motor. If you want to check and see if the dimensions re right for your printer you go to manage printers , select the printer you want and then select mange settings. If the dimension are off then you can edit it to make it right.
![image6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109770876/182918511-0f11c410-f22d-4b08-b012-bc74b19c7d5f.png)



 It is important to know the size of your printer because if you put the wrong dimension in. when the machine will try to print the nozzle might come down too hard and brake dust ruining your machine.
### 7.6.4 checking parameters
In older versions of cura the parameters needed to be added manually but in the version i'm using there are profiles with preset parameters.
To see these parameters you have to click on the top right corner menu item and then you will see these parameters.
![image12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109770876/182918602-4726a684-b62f-4d38-a6fe-ad8f2ed060d0.png)

Note : fill patern is the patern of the mesh stuff that is always ther when you print.
### 7.6.5 importing STL file to print.
To print you need and Stl file. An STL file is basically a file with youâ€™re 3d design on it. The steps to adding an stl file to cura are 1.go to file on cura and click add file. 2 Select Stl file and click on open.


Note :when printing make sure your object always lays flat because if it doesnt lay flat, it will most likely collapse. Cura has an option in the side bar that lays the object flat for yoy when you select it.
Note 2:after tselctig lay flat in the side you will see a notification pop up on th botoom tight side of your screen showing you how much time your object will take to print

### 7.6.6 generating Gcode.
When youâ€™re done adding an STL and setting up your parameters and dimensions, you need to save your object design. This is done by clicking save and saving the file with .gcode.
Gcode isâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..
After saving the file with .gcode you have to copy it to an sd card and then put that into the printer and your object will start printing.
